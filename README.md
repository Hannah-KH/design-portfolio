# 3-bootstrap-portfolio
## Description

The purpose behind this project was to adapt the portfolio page I created. This version is based on Bootstrap. Some particular features include:
- menu links jump to the relevant section
- my profile picture links to LinkedIn
- my 2 projects link to the deployed applications
- all links open in a new tab
- the design is responsive
- box shadow is applied to buttons on hover (in this case, cards that link somewhere)
- links are styled with a colour change on hover
